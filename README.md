- **Project Summary**: In this project, I examine the effectiveness of machine learning algorithms in predicting tweet sentiment using the X variable total retweets. I queried Twitter data containing the keyword 'Trump' between the years of 2018 and 2023, and then selected a segment to run preliminary analysis on. I then cleaned and applied sentiment analysis to the Tweets raw datafiles, classifying all Tweets into the categories 'positive', 'negative', and 'neutral'. I employed a variety of comparative machine learning algorithms on the data to attempt to generate an accurate predictive model (Fig. 3, Fig. 4). The best model performed at ~47% accuracy. However, since I classified Tweets into three categories, this is higher than would be predicted by random chance (33%). While the model is not currently refined enough to be used to practically predict Tweet sentiment, it does help inform future research. It is likely that including more variables in the model will refine predictions, resulting in a much higher success rate. For subsequent research, I will also include the variables 'total likes', 'total views', and additional text-based information, such as 'tweet length'.
