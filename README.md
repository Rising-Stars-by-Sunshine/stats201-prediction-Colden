- **Project Summary**: As one of the largest social media platforms, Twitter can be used as one barometer of public sentiment. In this project, I attempt to predict tweet sentiment as a function of total retweets. Twitter data containing the keyword 'Trump' was queried between the years of 2018 and 2023, and a random segment was chosen to run preliminary analysis on. The tweets text was cleaned (including removal of URLs and nonstandard characters) before applying sentiment analysis. All Tweets were classified into one of three categories, 'positive', 'negative', and 'neutral'. A variety of comparative machine learning algorithms were employed on the data to attempt to generate an accurate predictive model (Fig. 3, Fig. 4). The best model performs at a little above 47% accuracy. However, since Tweets were classified into three categories, this is higher than would be expected by random chance (33%). While the model is not currently refined enough to effectively predict Tweet sentiment outside of this testing environment, this project does help inform future research. It is likely that including more variables in the model will refine predictions, resulting in a much higher success rate. For subsequent research, I plan to add the variables 'total likes', 'total views', and additional text-based information, such as 'tweet length'. Additionally, I will attempt to run a larger dateset to further refine the models.
